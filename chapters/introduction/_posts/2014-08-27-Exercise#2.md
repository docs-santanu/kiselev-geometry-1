This is the **Transitivity of Congruence** of geometrical figures.

Two geometrical figures are congruent if one figure can be moved through the space to superimpose on the other such that the figures become identified with each other in all their parts. Now if _Figure-A_ is congruent with _Figure-B_ then _Figure-A_ can be moved through space and superimposed so that it can be identified with _Figure-B_ in all its parts. On the other hand, when _Figure-B_ is congruent with _Figure-C_ it can also be moved through space and superimposed to make it identified with _Figure-C_ in all its parts. Hence _Figure-A_ can be moved and superimposed on _Figure-C_ such that it is identified with _Figure-C_ in all its parts and the resultant superimposition movement is done in two steps - first _Figure-A_ would be superimposed on _Figure-B_ then that moved _Figure-A_ would be further moved to superimpose on _Figure-C_.
